This is my first blog post using Jekyll on StandardPixel.com.

I'll be writing about web development, design, and other things I find interesting. This site has been around since 2011, but I've finally added a proper blogging system using Jekyll.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a great choice for a static personal website because:

- It's simple and lightweight
- GitHub Pages has native support
- I can write posts in Markdown
- No database or server-side complexity

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

- Web development experiences and lessons learned
- Interface design and user experience
- Technology trends and tools
- Personal projects and experiments

Stay tuned for more posts!
