	<p class="subtle">This is a list of notable and public projects from the past few years. Most of my code since 2007 is proprietary to Yahoo, I can only share the projects which have been opensourced.</p>

	<h3>2011</h3>
	<h4>Interface for creating and managing Geofences</h4>
	<p class="subtle">This started as a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nolancaudill/5518277039/">hack</a> by some of us on the Flickr team. The goal was to make people more confident uploading photos to Flickr with geo information by giving them a simple way to block places they wish to keep privite.</p>

	<h3>2013</h3>
	<h4>StandardPixel Leaderboard</h4>
	<p class="subtle">A combined leaderboard for multiple types of activity tracker. I work on this when I have time so it is not as high quality as I would like. The only feature blocking it from being launched is the ability to invite friends and change your tracker type. It currently supports Fitbit and Moves app and uses Twitter for social graph and authentication.</p>
